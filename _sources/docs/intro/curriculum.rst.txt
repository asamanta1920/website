Curriculum Guide
========================

Course Overview
------------------------
The Racecar Middle School (RMS) curriculum focuses on teaching 3 main areas of interest:    

    1. Python (coding)
    2. OpenCV (computer vision)
    3. RACECAR (robotics)

More specifically, the curriculum can be divided into 5 modules:   

    - `Python <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/python.html>`_ - teaches you how to code in python
    - `Game Projects <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/projects.html>`_ - create your own games with your newfound progamming knowledge!
    - `OpenCV <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/opencv.html>`_ - introduces computer vision concepts and OpenCV functions through fun and interactive labs
    - `RACECAR <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/racecar.html>`_ - gets you started on using the RACECAR platform
    - `Final Challenge <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/finalchallenge.html>`_ - gives an overview of the RACECAR final challenge

Modules 1-2 focus on learning Python, Module 3 on OpenCV, and Module 4-5 on RACECAR. 

It is recommended that you go through the modules in order. Each section builds upon knowledge learned in the previous sections (ie. OpenCV builds upon Python knowledge, and RACECAR builds upon both Python and OpenCV knowledge)
