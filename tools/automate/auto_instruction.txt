links_with_title_and_class.json format:

{ <fileLocation> : [
    <Title>,
    <Links/stuff to replace>
        .
        .
        .
    <Template # to use / Must be at the very end!>
    ],
        .
        .
        .
    ]
}

How create_files.py works:
    input: 
        1. the path ext to add before each fileLocation (ie. ..) --> DON'T include '/' at the end cuz I've already done that for you 
        2. the .json file you're using to update the file 
    output:
        1. will change/add files specified @ fileLocation provided that the directories exist and the templates also exist 
        2. another file called 'updated_'+<your .json file> where the template number has been removed  
    important note:
        - always run python create_files.py and not python <directories>/create_files.py cuz we'd need to change some stuff then (may do later) 
        - we will ignore <fileLocation> in which the last element is not a integer/Template #  
        - cp 'updated_'+<your .json file> <your .json file> if you do not want create_files.py to touch that file again 
            - (just add template # if you want to change that file)  


To create new file with existing template: 
   - add an entry to .json file you're using or create a new .json file in same format as above  
   - make sure to add a Template # at the very END

To create a new template:
   1. create a template file (see tmp4.txt or tmp5.txt as example)
   2. create a template function in create_files.py (see file4 or file5 as an example) 
        --> it should have same parameters as file4 or file5 unless you're touching createFiles() function 
        --> make sure the function is defined above main() & the global functions above main()
   3. add your template file to TEMPLATE list and your template function to TEMPLATE_FUNC (make sure they're at the same index)
   4. the index of TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE_FUNC (they should be same) will be the Template # 
   5. add Template # to the end of the files you want to change 



**** Do not use a # as the last entry of of your <fileLocation> list unless it's a Template #; you can even add a filler if necessary ****







~~~~~~ Unnecessary updates to create ~~~~~~
*** make TEMPLATE/TEMPLATE_FUNC into dictionary for readability & more flexibility *** 
***** make .json into a {<fileLoc>: {Template:... Link:...}} so that we don't need to write a new template function everytime :) ***** 
** use argparse instead of input() so that we can redirect stuff **
* add sth so we can do <directories>/create_files.py and then enter <directories> as input so we can run @ different locs *
