Curriculum Guide
======================

The curriculum is split into 3 primary sections:    

    1. `Python <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/python.html>`_ (+ `Game Projects <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/projects.html>`_)     
    2. `OpenCV <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/opencv.html>`_     
    3. `RACECAR <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/racecar.html>`_ (+ `Final Challenge <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/finalchallenge.html>`_)      
      
The hardware/software used for the Python/OpenCV sections are separate from the hardware/software used in the RACECAR section of the curriculum:  

    - The Python and OpenCV labs can be done on your own computer/laptop.     
    - The RACECAR labs must be run on the racecars themselves.


Python / OpenCV Labs
-----------------------
The `Python <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/python.html>`_ / `OpenCV <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/opencv.html>`_ labs can be run directly on your own computer/laptop (with the necessary software installations). The installation instructions and lab tutorials can be found here. It is recommended that you follow these tutorials in order:       

    - `Software Setup for Python and OpenCV <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBV25Wrk2XgS7Xtwo6VbOBgRdlEv5sZyZWhrb94gW1I>`_     
    - `How to Use Jupyter Notebook <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Eoj9dEZZ_snuPFJfjFdRY2UJT_USRZldwWrDpEEG_po>`_     
    - Getting Started with the Python Labs (TBD)    
    - Practicing with Python Game Labs (TBD)     
    - Getting Started with the OpenCV Labs (TBD) 

RACECAR Labs
-----------------------
The `RACECAR <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/racecar.html>`_ labs will require the RACECAR hardware platform. All the software will run on the RACECAR itself. You will need to build the RACECAR and set up the software accordingly. It is recommended that you follow these tutorials in order:     

    - `Bill of Materials <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pgc1RaVsBujjWzoO6uu5cKgIHgrCsZyRMPaoN123keA>`_     
    - `RACECAR Mounting Plate CAD Files <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NnhHsqurChNSBMjVC_DKC72OVTiFB8WH>`_     
    - `Parts Reference Guide <https://drive.google.com/open?id=127jLZJWT-LyYTPfUTLrZreGLeHtRsFCoxsgmiJG9umg>`_     
    - `Hardware Build Instructions <https://drive.google.com/open?id=10djr9rF30_IfCtFhpvcpBh4owcSxtMIHP9qJA1nfyzw>`_    
    - `Software Setup Instructions <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1M99XklgR7pGS7_aW9fb94www9bNnznq7wxQn7z4suWw>`_    
    - Startup Instructions (`Using Router <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pgABl3y5eCxhEvG3m_-YYVbir-jgchQdEARMv4wjGJw>`_ - or - `Using Mini Monitor <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iObOk55nPjIR_JX4Lw0xafy0AV1w7wYxuxSH8MhRbTk>`_)     
    - Getting Started with the RACECAR Labs (TBD)      
    - Getting Started with the Final Challenge (TBD)
