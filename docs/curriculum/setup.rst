Module 0: Getting Started
==================================

Setting Up
----------------------------------
The setup process can be divided into 2 parts:   

    1. Setting up for Python and OpenCV Labs
    2. Setting up for RACECAR Labs

The hardware/software used for the Python and OpenCV labs is different from the hardware/software used for the RACECAR labs:  

    - The Python and OpenCV labs can be done on your own computer/laptop.     
    - The RACECAR labs must be run on the racecars themselves.


Python and OpenCV Labs
----------------------------------
The `Python <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/python.html>`_ and `OpenCV <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/opencv.html>`_ labs can be run directly on your own computer/laptop (with the necessary software installations). The installation instructions and lab tutorials are below. It is recommended that you follow these tutorials in order:       

    1. `Software Setup for Python and OpenCV <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBV25Wrk2XgS7Xtwo6VbOBgRdlEv5sZyZWhrb94gW1I>`_     
    2. `How to Use Jupyter Notebook <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Eoj9dEZZ_snuPFJfjFdRY2UJT_USRZldwWrDpEEG_po>`_     
    3. Getting Started with the Python Labs (TBD)    
    4. Practicing with Python Game Labs (TBD)     
    5. Getting Started with the OpenCV Labs (TBD) 


RACECAR Labs
----------------------------------
The `RACECAR <https://mit-bwsi-racecar-ms.github.io/website/docs/curriculum/racecar.html>`_ labs will require the RACECAR hardware platform. All the software will run on the RACECAR itself. You will need to build the RACECAR and set up the software accordingly. It is recommended that you follow these tutorials in order:     

    1. `Hardware Build Instructions <https://drive.google.com/open?id=10djr9rF30_IfCtFhpvcpBh4owcSxtMIHP9qJA1nfyzw>`_

    4. Getting Started with the RACECAR Labs (TBD)    
      
    5. Getting Started with the Final Challenge (TBD) 

Debugging
